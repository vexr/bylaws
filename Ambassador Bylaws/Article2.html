<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Roles of Ambassadors</h2>
<p>Ambassadors are people who have demonstrated an interest in and ability to help accomplish the Mission and Objectives
  of the Program and who have been selected by the selection procedures outlined herein.</p>
<ol>
  <li id="section1">Applicant Selection. Any member of the community may apply to begin the process of becoming an
    Ambassador. Each
    Applicant must provide information to present their skills and experience, how they would like to contribute to
    the program, and must provide their legal name, an actively monitored email address, and an active Discord
    handle. The Applicant’s legal name must be the name used on the Ambassador Agreement and for any required Know
    Your Customer validation that occurs prior to token issuance. Apprentice Ambassadors will be selected from the
    Applicants, and Ambassadors will be selected from the Apprentices after an apprenticeship period. The selection
    of Apprentices and Ambassadors shall be according to a transparent procedure defined by the Onboarding and
    Growth Team.</li>

  <li id="section3">Selection of Lead Ambassadors. An Ambassador may be selected to be a Lead Ambassador within an
    Official Team by
    a vote of the Ambassadors within the team. Each team must have at least one Lead Ambassador who fluently speaks
    English. If any team does not currently have an English-speaking lead, the next Lead Ambassador elected must have
    English fluency. If at any time a team has at least one lead, but no English-speaking Lead Ambassador, that team
    shall immediately open one additional Lead Ambassador role, with the English-speaking requirement. Any Ambassadors
    may apply for a Lead vacancy by presenting their ideas and plans to the team, and the decision will be made using
    simple majority in case of 1 or 2 candidates, or may use ranked choice or simple majority in case of more than 2
    candidates. The election for a Lead Ambassador must be advertised at least 30 days in advance with a call for
    nominations, and the election shall be held within 45 days of the vacancy unless another election date shall be set
    by a vote of the majority of the current Lead Ambassadors plus the Sponsor Representative. No vacancy shall be left
    open for more than six months without holding an election.</li>

    <li id="section8paragraph4">Coordinating Across Teams. Lead Ambassadors are expected to coordinate the activities
      and directions
      the team is taking in areas that may impact or benefit from the support of other teams. As a group,
      Lead Ambassadors are expected to create clarity among the various teams and take care of conflicts,
      overlaps, and gaps across the various purposes, directions, and activities of the teams they lead.
    </li>
    <li id="section8paragraph5">Ambassador Selection. Lead Ambassadors are expected to ensure that Ambassador Selection
      is occurring
      for openings on their team, providing feedback and encouraging qualified Apprentices to apply, and
      ensuring applications are being reviewed and quality feedback given to applicants.</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="section9">Contributions and Inventions. While an Ambassador is actively earning tokens as an Ambassador or
    Lead
    Ambassador, any and all work produced under the Program, including any work submitted to Peer Review
    Process, and including the underlying work products and associated intellectual property of the
    Ambassador therein, is deemed a Contribution and will be licensed to Sponsor via the Apache License,
    Version 2.0 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">
      <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</span>
    </a>).</li>
  <li id="section10">Peer Review Process. A Peer Review Process operated by the Governance team will validate the
    performance
    of Applicant, Apprentice Ambassador, Ambassador and Lead Ambassador Obligations.</li>
  <ol>
    <li id="section10paragraph1">Peer Groups. The Peer Review Process is conducted within peer groups, where there is a
      group for
      Applicants, another group for Apprentices, and a group for Ambassadors which includes Lead
      Ambassadors. If a Peer Group is not larger than 30 people for any review period, it may be combined
      with another Peer Group at the discretion of the Governance Team.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph2">Review Period. Each Peer Review Process will evaluate submissions within a calendar
      month. Each Ambassador
      shall have seven (7) days to provide submissions, and seven (7) days to complete their assigned peer review
      evaluations once distributed.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph3">Submissions. Each Ambassador must create transparency by communicating their
      incremental
      Contributions each month. The submission must provide sufficient detail to identify the
      Contribution(s), validate that they were made during the relevant month, and enable other peers to
      review and evaluate the Contributions.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph4">Evaluations. Each Ambassador in good standing as defined in Article 2, Section 13, at
      the time
      evaluation requests are generated must review and score the Contributions of other randomly selected
      peers each month according to this Process.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph5">Failure to Participate. Failure to Participate in the Peer Review process means, during
      any single
      peer review cycle, any one of the following violations: i) not providing a Submission on time, or
      ii) not returning at least one of the requested peer evaluations on time. For purposes of this section,
      multiple review rounds for a single calendar month of submissions shall be considered one peer review
      cycle. Any Ambassador who fails to submit evaluations in an initial round shall be excluded from selection
      as an evaluator in any supplementary rounds for the relevant month. If any Ambassador or Lead Ambassador
      incurs a Failure to Participate more than twice in any contiguous 6-month period, such person will be
      automatically terminated from the Program.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph6">Inadequate Contribution. Scoring Inadequate for the Published Score for 2 or more
      months of any
      rolling 6-month period will automatically refer a Complaint to the Conflict Resolution Team, and the
      Ambassador's status will be updated to Inadequate Contribution until resolved by the Conflict
      Resolution Team.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph7">Scores. After each Peer Review Process, the Sponsor shall publish updated scores
      ("Published Score")
      which shall be "Adequate" or "Inadequate" for each Ambassador. Submissions are to be evaluated as
      "Adequate" or "Inadequate" by each of up to 3 reviewers in the Peer Review Process. Each "Adequate"
      review will be scored as 3.0, and each "Inadequate" review will be scored as 1.0. The Published Score
      will be determined by the average of the reviews recorded for the period for each Ambassador, with a
      score of less than 2.0 being "Inadequate", and a score of 2.0 or higher being "Adequate".</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph8">Ambassadors are expected to demonstrate meaningful contribution each month toward the
      responsibilities
      of their selected Primary Team, as outlined in Article 3, Section 1.3.</li>
    <li id="section10paragraph9">Minimum Review Requirement. Up to three (3) attempts should be made to ensure that each
      Ambassador is afforded
      three (3) peer reviews per evaluation period. When necessary, up to two (2) supplementary review rounds shall be
      conducted for those Ambassadors' submissions that do not already have three (3) reviews received. If more than
      three (3) reviews are received, only the first three (3) reviews received will be counted.</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="section11">Removal of Ambassadors. Ambassadors may be removed from the program for failing to fulfill the
    Obligations of Ambassadors or by resignation. Any failure to fulfill the Obligations will be determined
    by the Conflict Resolution Team in accordance with the Conflict Resolution procedures. Any such
    determination shall be forwarded to the Sponsor for Termination of the Ambassador, and removal will be
    complete when the Ambassador Agreement has been confirmed to be terminated. The Onboarding and Growth
    Team is responsible for revoking any necessary Ambassador Rights upon Termination.</li>
  <li id="section12">Recall of Lead Ambassadors. A Lead Ambassador may be Recalled by the relevant Team based on a
    Supermajority vote of no confidence in the Lead, combined with, when there is not at least one remaining
    Lead Ambassador, the selection of a new Lead. The Team so voting shall notify the Governance Team and
    the Sponsor as to the Demotion of the Lead Ambassador, and the Selection of the new Lead Ambassador.</li>
  <li id="section13">Good Standing. An Ambassador shall be considered to be in Good Standing so long as the Ambassador
    i) is compliant with the Bylaws and their Ambassador Agreement, ii) has no unresolved Complaints before the
    Conflict Resolution Team, except for complaints regarding Governance Participation, iii) is not
    currently Failing to Participate or having Inadequate Contribution in the Peer Review Process.</li>
  <li id="section14">Transferability. Membership in the Program and any associated benefits are not transferable.

    whose tokens are lost, stolen, or otherwise improperly managed.</li>
