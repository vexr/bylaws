<h2 id="article2">Article 2. Roles of Ambassadors</h2>
<p>Ambassadors are people who have demonstrated an interest in and ability to help accomplish the Mission and Objectives
  of the Program and who have been selected by the selection procedures outlined herein.</p>
<ol>
  <li id="section1">Applicant Selection. Any member of the community may apply to begin the process of becoming an
    Ambassador. Each
    Applicant must provide information to present their skills and experience, how they would like to contribute to
    the program, and must provide their legal name, an actively monitored email address, and an active Discord
    handle. The Applicant’s legal name must be the name used on the Ambassador Agreement and for any required Know
    Your Customer validation that occurs prior to token issuance. Apprentice Ambassadors will be selected from the
    Applicants, and Ambassadors will be selected from the Apprentices after an apprenticeship period. The selection
    of Apprentices and Ambassadors shall be according to a transparent procedure defined by the Onboarding and
    Growth Team.</li>
  <li id="section2">Ambassador Term. Each Ambassador is expected to commit to the role for 4 years. Each ambassador that
    joined
    under the Legacy Ambassador Token Grant period is expected to commit to the role for 2 years. Ambassadors may
    re-apply to serve in subsequent terms after completion of any term.</li>
  <li id="section3">Selection of Lead Ambassadors. An Ambassador may be selected to be a Lead Ambassador within an
    Official Team by
    a vote of the Ambassadors within the team. Each team must have at least one Lead Ambassador who fluently speaks
    English. If any team does not currently have an English-speaking lead, the next Lead Ambassador elected must have
    English fluency. If at any time a team has at least one lead, but no English-speaking Lead Ambassador, that team
    shall immediately open one additional Lead Ambassador role, with the English-speaking requirement. Any Ambassadors
    may apply for a Lead vacancy by presenting their ideas and plans to the team, and the decision will be made using
    simple majority in case of 1 or 2 candidates, or may use ranked choice or simple majority in case of more than 2
    candidates. The election for a Lead Ambassador must be advertised at least 30 days in advance with a call for
    nominations, and the election shall be held within 45 days of the vacancy unless another election date shall be set
    by a vote of the majority of the current Lead Ambassadors plus the Sponsor Representative. No vacancy shall be left
    open for more than six months without holding an election.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Legacy Ambassador Token Grant.
      <strong>Ambassadors joining the program prior to October 2023 receive the Legacy Ambassador Token
        Grant.</strong>
      Ambassadors under the Legacy grant will earn up to 0.00526% of the total token supply during their 2-year
      term. The allocation per quarter shall be: 1) 0.00219%, 2) 0.00076%, 3) 0.00063%, 4) 0.00042%, 5) 0.00036%,
      6) 0.00032%, 7) 0.00029%, and 8) 0.00029%. Vesting for the Legacy Ambassador Token Grant is over two years,
      including a 6-month cliff vest of 25%, with the remainder vesting evenly per month over the following 18
      months. All tokens are subject to a six (6) month lock-up and may not be transferred or withdrawn until 6
      months after Mainnet Beta commences. Vesting starts on the day the ambassador is admitted to the Program.
      All allocations under the Legacy Ambassador Token Grant ceased incremental grants or accrual on December 31,
      2023, and vesting shall continue until the end of the relevant Ambassadors vesting term. All further vesting
      will cease upon Termination of an Ambassador. Illustrative examples include the following.
      <ol>
        <li>If an Ambassador participated in the program for 6 months and a day, then left, they would be
          allocated
          .00219% + .00076 = .00295%, and since they left the program after 6 months, they would be 25%
          vested.
          After mainnet and the 6-month lockup period per the Distribution of Tokens have passed, the example
          Ambassador would receive SSC equivalent to 0.0007375% of the token supply.</li>
        <li>For the same scenario as above, if the Ambassador had joined the program on October 1, 2023, the
          Ambassador would receive just the first quarter allocation of .00219%, which would still be 25%
          vested
          and the Ambassador would instead receive 0.0005475%.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Ambassador Token Grant.
      <strong>Ambassadors admitted to the program on or after January 1, 2024</strong>
      will be allocated an award that shall vest over 4 years with a six-month cliff vesting 12.5% and the
      remaining 87.5% vesting monthly over the remaining 42 months. All tokens are subject to a six (6) month
      lock-up and may not be transferred or withdrawn until 6 months after Mainnet Beta commences. All further
      vesting will cease upon Termination of an Ambassador. The size of the award shall be determined based on
      when the Ambassador is selected as an Apprentice Ambassador, according to the following table. The Award
      will be granted and vesting will begin on the date that the Apprentice is promoted to Ambassador and
      admitted as an Ambassador to the Program.

    <li>Legacy Lead Ambassador Token Grant. Lead Ambassadors that were promoted prior to Mainnet Beta earn a
      pro-rata portion of the lead ambassador token pool for the Testnet network phase based on their active
      months of participation. The token allocation for the Testnet network for legacy lead ambassadors
      (“Testnet Lead Ambassador Pool”) is 0.10% of the token supply. The earning of tokens for each Lead
      Ambassador from the phase token pool will be based on the i) number months the Lead Ambassador has
      performed in the role, divided by ii) the total number of Lead Ambassador months performed by all Lead
      Ambassadors, multiplied by iii) the Testnet Lead Ambassador Pool. This allocation vests over 4 years
      with a 6 month cliff, which is counted from the Lead Ambassador promotion date, vesting 12.5% and the
      remaining 87.5% vesting over the remaining 42 months. All tokens are subject to a six (6) month lock-up

      and may not be transferred or withdrawn until 6 months after Mainnet Beta commences. All further vesting
      will cease in the event of Termination of the Lead Ambassador. The size of the award shall be determined
      based on when the Ambassador becomes a Lead Ambassador, according to the following table.

    <li>Impact on Ambassador Token Grant. While serving in a Lead Ambassador role and earning the Lead Token
      Grant, earning of tokens under the relevant Ambassador Token Grant or Legacy Ambassador Token Grant will
      continue, with vesting running in parallel on both the relevant Ambassador Token Grant grant and the
      relevant Lead Ambassador Token Grant.</li>
    <li>Role Assignment. Lead Ambassadors will be assigned roles in relevant communications platforms to allow
      them to speak as Lead Ambassadors in the community.</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="section8">Obligations of Lead Ambassadors.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Ambassadors. Lead Ambassadors are Ambassadors and are subject to all of the Obligations of
      Ambassadors, in addition to the incremental obligations here.</li>
    <li>Working Hours. Lead Ambassadors will be responsible for an additional 24 hours of work within each 4
      calendar weeks for a total, including their 16 hours of Ambassador obligation, of 40 hours per
      4-week period, or 10 hours per week on average.</li>
    <li>Coordinating Team. Lead Ambassadors are expected to coordinate and support the efforts of the Teams
      they participate in. According to the values of Permissionless and Decentralized, Leads are to
      operate with the consent of the Team and are not to manage, assign, or delegate, but are to create
      supporting infrastructure, transparency, and clarity of team purpose that invite and enable the
      contribution of Ambassadors within the team.</li>
    <li>Coordinating Across Teams. Lead Ambassadors are expected to coordinate the activities and directions
      the team is taking in areas that may impact or benefit from the support of other teams. As a group,
      Lead Ambassadors are expected to create clarity among the various teams and take care of conflicts,
      overlaps, and gaps across the various purposes, directions, and activities of the teams they lead.
    </li>
    <li>Ambassador Selection. Lead Ambassadors are expected to ensure that Ambassador Selection is occurring
      for openings on their team, providing feedback and encouraging qualified Apprentices to apply, and
      ensuring applications are being reviewed and quality feedback given to applicants.</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="section9">Contributions and Inventions. While an Ambassador is actively earning tokens as an Ambassador or
    Lead
    Ambassador, any and all work produced under the Program, including any work submitted to Peer Review
    Process, and including the underlying work products and associated intellectual property of the
    Ambassador therein, is deemed a Contribution and will be licensed to Sponsor via the Apache License,
    Version 2.0 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">
      <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</span>
    </a>).</li>
  <li id="section10">Peer Review Process. A Peer Review Process operated by the Governance team will validate the
    performance
    of Applicant, Apprentice Ambassador, Ambassador and Lead Ambassador Obligations.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Peer Groups. The Peer Review Process is conducted within peer groups, where there is a group for
      Applicants, another group for Apprentices, and a group for Ambassadors which includes Lead
      Ambassadors. If a Peer Group is not larger than 30 people for any review period, it may be combined
      with another Peer Group at the discretion of the Governance Team.</li>
    <li>Review Period. Each Peer Review Process will evaluate submissions within a calendar month. Each Ambassador
      shall have seven (7) days to provide submissions, and seven (7) days to complete their assigned peer review
      evaluations once distributed.</li>
    <li>Submissions. Each Ambassador must create transparency by communicating their incremental
      Contributions each month. The submission must provide sufficient detail to identify the
      Contribution(s), validate that they were made during the relevant month, and enable other peers to
      review and evaluate the Contributions.</li>
    <li>Evaluations. Each Ambassador in good standing as defined in Article 2, Section 13, at the time
      evaluation requests are generated must review and score the Contributions of other randomly selected
      peers each month according to this Process.</li>
    <li>Failure to Participate. Failure to Participate in the Peer Review process means, during any single
      peer review cycle, any one of the following violations: i) not providing a Submission on time,
      ii) not returning at least one of the requested peer evaluations on time, or iii) receiving a score
      of zero on two or more evaluations. For purposes of this section, multiple review rounds for a single
      calendar month of submissions shall be considered one peer review cycle. Any Ambassador who fails to
      submit evaluations in an initial round shall be excluded from selection as an evaluator in any
      supplementary rounds for the relevant month. If any Ambassador or Lead Ambassador incurs a Failure
      to Participate more than twice in any contiguous 6-month period, such person will be automatically
      terminated from the Program.</li>
    <li>Inadequate Contribution. Scoring less than 3.0 as the monthly score for 2 or more months of any
      rolling 6-month period will automatically refer a Complaint to the Conflict Resolution Team, and the
      Ambassador's status will be updated to Inadequate Contribution until resolved by the Conflict
      Resolution Team.</li>
    <li>Scores, Allocation and Vesting Confirmation. After each Peer Review Process, the Sponsor shall
      publish updated scores and an updated vesting schedule for each Ambassador noting their current
      allocation and vesting. The score for any Ambassador that did not provide Submissions will be 0 for
      that period.</li>
    <li>Ambassadors are expected to demonstrate meaningful contribution each month toward the responsibilities
      of their selected Primary Team, as outlined in Article 3, Section 1.3.</li>
    <li>Minimum Review Requirement. Up to three (3) attempts should be made to ensure that each Ambassador is afforded
      three (3) peer reviews per evaluation period. When necessary, up to two (2) supplementary review rounds shall be
      conducted for those Ambassadors' submissions that do not already have three (3) reviews received. If more than
      three (3) reviews are received, only the first three (3) reviews received will be counted.</li>
  </ol>
  <li id="section11">Removal of Ambassadors. Ambassadors may be removed from the program for failing to fulfill the
    Obligations of Ambassadors or by resignation. Any failure to fulfill the Obligations will be determined
    by the Conflict Resolution Team in accordance with the Conflict Resolution procedures. Any such
    determination shall be forwarded to the Sponsor for Termination of the Ambassador, and removal will be
    complete when the Ambassador Agreement has been confirmed to be terminated. The Onboarding and Growth
    Team is responsible for revoking any necessary Ambassador Rights upon Termination.</li>
  <li id="section12">Recall of Lead Ambassadors. A Lead Ambassador may be Recalled by the relevant Team based on a
    Supermajority vote of no confidence in the Lead, combined with, when there is not at least one remaining
    Lead Ambassador, the selection of a new Lead. The Team so voting shall notify the Governance Team and
    the Sponsor as to the Demotion of the Lead Ambassador, and the Selection of the new Lead Ambassador.</li>
  <li id="section13">Good Standing. An Ambassador shall be considered to be in Good Standing so long as the Ambassador
    i) is compliant with the Bylaws and their Ambassador Agreement, ii) has no unresolved Complaints before the
    Conflict Resolution Team, except for complaints regarding Governance Participation, iii) is not
    currently Failing to Participate or having Inadequate Contribution in the Peer Review Process.</li>
  <li id="section14">Transferability. Membership in the Program and any associated benefits are not transferable.
    Ambassadors must make their own provisions for inheritance, and the Program will be unable to assist an ambassador
    whose tokens are lost, stolen, or otherwise improperly managed.</li>
